Given an array 𝐴 consisting of 𝑛 positive integers, let’s assume that we want to find a
positive integer 𝑘 such that the total sum of the distances between all elements of 𝐴 and 𝑘
becomes minimized, i.e., 𝑠 = min ∑ 𝑑𝑖 , where i is between 1 and n, and 𝑑𝑖 = |𝐴[𝑖] − 𝑘| is the distance between 𝐴[𝑖] and
𝑘. Write code that prints 𝑠, given an array 𝐴 of length 𝑛.
